# RPM_POST_MARKET_SURVEILLANCE_PLAN.md

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the post-market surveillance (PMS) plan for the NeuroGrid Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) system. Its purpose is to continuously monitor safety, performance, reliability, and real-world behavior after deployment, ensuring early detection of risk and sustained regulatory compliance.

## 2. Scope
This plan applies to:
- Deployed RPM devices and integrations
- RPM data pipelines and processing layers
- AI-assisted RPM analytics and alerts
- Clinical dashboards consuming RPM outputs
- Supporting infrastructure with RPM dependency

The plan applies throughout the operational lifecycle of the RPM system.

## 3. Surveillance Objectives
Post-market surveillance aims to:
- Detect safety signals and adverse trends
- Monitor real-world system performance
- Identify data integrity or reliability degradation
- Capture clinician feedback and disagreement
- Ensure continued alignment with approved use
- Support regulatory reporting obligations

## 4. Surveillance Data Sources
Surveillance activities draw from:
- RPM system logs and telemetry
- Data anomaly and escalation records
- AI output escalation and review logs
- Clinician override and disagreement logs
- Incident response and recovery reports
- User-reported issues and complaints
- Audit and oversight findings

All sources must be traceable and immutable.

## 5. Safety Signal Detection
Safety signals include:
- Increased false positive or false negative alerts
- Delayed or missed alerts
- Recurrent data anomalies
- Elevated clinician disagreement rates
- Incident clustering or recurrence
- Unanticipated use patterns

Signal detection thresholds are predefined and reviewed periodically.

## 6. Performance Monitoring
The following are continuously monitored:
- Data completeness and timeliness
- Alert accuracy and relevance
- System uptime and latency
- Model confidence distribution
- Escalation frequency by severity

Deviations trigger investigation.

## 7. Trend Analysis
Longitudinal analysis is conducted to identify:
- Gradual performance degradation
- Bias emergence or drift
- Device-specific reliability issues
- Population-specific anomalies

Trend findings are documented and reviewed.

## 8. Feedback Intake
Feedback is collected from:
- Clinicians and operators
- Oversight committees
- External auditors
- Where applicable, patients or study participants

Feedback mechanisms are non-punitive and auditable.

## 9. Evaluation and Review Cycle
Post-market surveillance reviews occur:
- Continuously via automated monitoring
- Periodically via formal review cycles
- Ad hoc following incidents or alerts

Review cadence is risk-adjusted.

## 10. Corrective and Preventive Actions
When issues are identified:
- Root cause analysis is performed
- Corrective actions are defined and implemented
- Preventive measures are introduced
- Effectiveness is verified post-implementation

Actions are logged and governed.

## 11. Escalation and Reporting
Findings may be escalated to:
- Clinical oversight
- Safety Council
- Governance bodies
- Regulatory authorities where required

Failure to escalate is a governance breach.

## 12. Regulatory Reporting
This plan supports reporting obligations under:
- FDA post-market surveillance expectations
- EU MDR / IVDR vigilance requirements
- EU AI Act post-deployment monitoring
- Applicable data protection regulations

Reports are accurate, timely, and documented.

## 13. Documentation and Recordkeeping
All PMS activities are:
- Logged immutably
- Timestamped
- Retained per data and governance retention policies
- Available for audit and inspection

Record suppression is prohibited.

## 14. Continuous Improvement
Surveillance outcomes inform:
- System design updates
- Monitoring enhancements
- Governance refinements
- Training and operational changes

Repeated signals trigger heightened oversight.

## 15. Responsibility
Responsibility for execution rests with:
- RPM Operations Team
- Clinical Oversight Representatives
- Safety Council
- Compliance Officer

Delegation does not remove accountability.

## 16. Status
Active – Mandatory RPM Post-Market Surveillance Plan
