# NeuroGrid — One-Page System Overview

## What NeuroGrid Is

**NeuroGrid** is a deterministic coordination protocol for **medical-grade computation, governance, and verifiable artifacts**.

The system is designed to support **trust-minimized medical AI infrastructure** without performing diagnosis, treatment, or autonomous clinical decision-making.

NeuroGrid is **infrastructure-only**.

## MedIntel is an off-chain integration stub. No AI execution occurs in this repository.

### MedIntel (STUBBED)
- AI pipeline and analytics interfaces
- **Intentionally non-executing**
- No inference, no model execution, no patient data
- Preserved as a compliance-safe integration surface
- Designed for post-audit and post-regulatory activation

---

## Design Principles

NeuroGrid enforces:

- **Determinism** — reproducible execution paths
- **Accountability** — fault-bound validators and explicit failure states
- **Transparency** — no opaque inference
- **Safety-first design** — no silent execution, no hidden control

There are **no privileged execution paths** and **no implicit trust assumptions**.

---

## Regulatory & Safety Positioning

NeuroGrid:
- Does **not** handle patient data
- Does **not** make medical claims
- Does **not** replace clinicians
- Does **not** perform autonomous medical decisions

It is designed to **support compliance**, not bypass it.

## Why BNB Chain (opBNB)

NeuroGrid is deployed on **opBNB Testnet** due to:

- EVM compatibility
- Scalable execution for deterministic coordination
- Strong alignment with governance-heavy protocols
- Clean testnet deployment and evaluation environment
- Future readiness for DeSci and AI ecosystems

---

## Current Status

- Core contracts deployed on **opBNB Testnet**
- Open-source and hackathon-compliant
- ≥2 successful on-chain transactions completed
- Core logic **frozen for audit and evaluation**

---

## Final Note

NeuroGrid demonstrates **responsible AI system architecture**.

It is intentionally conservative, audit-first, and governance-aware —  
built to **earn trust before demanding adoption**.
