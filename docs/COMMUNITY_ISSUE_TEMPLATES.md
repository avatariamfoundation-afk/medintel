## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **standardized issue reporting formats** for the NeuroGrid MedIntel repository.

It is intentionally placed in `/docs/` to:
- Remain **judge-visible without GitHub UI navigation**
- Demonstrate **process maturity** independent of platform tooling
- Serve as the **single source of truth** for community interaction rules

This project prioritizes **signal over volume**, **clarity over engagement**, and **execution over discussion**.

---

## 2. Community Interaction Principles

All community issues must adhere to the following principles:

1. **Deterministic** – Clearly reproducible or verifiable  
2. **Scoped** – Within MedIntel’s documented medical boundaries  
3. **Non-Clinical** – No diagnosis, treatment, or medical advice  
4. **Actionable** – Leads to a concrete outcome  

Issues failing these principles may be closed with explanation.

---

## 3. Standard Issue Categories

The MedIntel project recognizes **four issue classes**:

1. Bug Report  
2. Documentation Issue  
3. Feature / Enhancement Proposal  
4. Research or Integration Inquiry  

Each class follows a strict format.

- Vague ideation without a problem statement  
- Marketing, promotion, or engagement farming  

Closures will include a brief rationale.

---

## 9. Judge-Facing Rationale

This document demonstrates:

- Open-source governance maturity  
- Responsible handling of medical-adjacent software  
- Clear contributor expectations  
- Readiness for post-hackathon community scaling  

It intentionally avoids performative engagement metrics.

---

## 10. Maintenance & Evolution

- This document may evolve as MedIntel scales
- Changes will be versioned and documented
- Historical issues remain auditable
